###Task: User System that can create a new user (first name, last name, username > tuple) or print all current users. We will use EasyGUI to ask our questions/makeusers and to print our list.

###Access EasyGUI
import easygui as easy
###Screen/Output?
screen = easy.choicebox("create a user or create list with exiting user","choose:",("create user",'create list'))


###List definitions
subusers = [("five","four","three"),("two","one","zero")]
def choose_ ();


###User Data Types 
##first_name
##last_name
msg = "Enter your information"
title = "Demographics"
info = ["First Name", "Last Name"]

rValues = []  
rValues = easy.multenterbox(msg,title,info)


##username

box = "make a username"
box2 = "your username"
box3= ["username", "password"]

rValues2 = []  
rValues2 =  easy.multenterbox(box,box2,box3)

###Helper Functions

#PrintUsers - Prints all current users
#Optional: Check for numerics in first and last - use with make a user?
